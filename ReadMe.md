1. [sun_earth.csv](sun_earth.svg)

   Data for the Sun and Earth in SI units.


2. [sgrAstar.csv](sgrAstar.csv)

   Data of approx 13 star (I don't know which) near the centre of the
   galaxy.

   Units are in *arcseconds* from the black hole.  And the distance
   from the Earth to the black hole is approx 8 Kpc.

   This initial data corresponds to t = 1995.0200 (step = 1) in
   stars13.dat.

   **Length units**: Each unit is an arcseconds distance from the
   black hole.  The center of our galaxy is about 8000 parsecs (or 8
   kiloparsecs) from Earth.  At that distance, 1 arcsecond is ~0.04
   parsecs = 8000 astronomical units (AU).

   Time is measured in years.

   Mass is measured in solar masses.
